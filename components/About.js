        <p className='text-lg mt-2 md:text-2xl md:mt-7 md:text-center'>
        Threshold testing plays a pivotal role in triathlon training and performance optimization. 
        Understanding and regularly assessing individual thresholds, such 
        <span className='font-bold capitalize'> critical swim speed (CSS)</span> and 
        <span className='font-bold capitalize'> critical power (CP)</span>, 
        is crucial for tailoring training programs to specific needs. 
        These tests provide valuable insights into an athlete's physiological
        limits and help identify the intensity at which the body transitions from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism. 
        </p>
        <p className='text-lg mt-2 md:text-2xl md:mt-7 md:text-center'>
        By pinpointing these thresholds, athletes and coaches can design 
        training zones that enhance <span className='font-bold capitalize'> endurance</span>, 
        <span className='font-bold capitalize'> power</span>, and 
        <span className='font-bold capitalize'> speed </span>
        while minimizing the risk of <span className='font-bold underline decoration-black'>overtraining</span> and 
        <span className='font-bold underline decoration-black'> injury</span>. 
        Ultimately, threshold testing is an indispensable tool for fine-tuning 
        triathlon training strategies, ensuring that athletes reach their peak fitness levels and achieve their competitive goals.
